# Implementing a Multicycle ARM processor on a Xilinx ZedBoard

Implementing a subset of ARM instruction set architecture in a multicycle microarchitecture using Xilinx Vivado IDE for a project of my MSc course on Digital Systems Design at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens by the proffesors [N. Kranitis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ps8mOuMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [A. Paschalis](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=q8LRbY4AAAAJ&hl=el). The goal was to create a processor implementing some of the simple instructions of the ARM instruction set.

Inside the folder 'PROJECT_2.srcs' are all the VHDL sources I wrote. Inside the folder 'ARM Assembly' there are two files. 'testbench.s' is the set of ARM instructions that was loaded in the processor's ROM to prove its functionality and implementation of all the ARM instructions it supports. The ARM instructions are also explained in that folder. Inside the 'Documentation' folder is my project report for the course in Greek language.
